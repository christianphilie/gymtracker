# Agent Notes (Shim)

Canonical agent/project notes now live in `docs/AGENTS.md`.

This root file remains intentionally small so agent tooling can still discover the most important local rule quickly.

## UI Copy Style

- UI strings that consist of a single sentence should not end with a period
- Keep periods for multi-sentence text and numbered step instructions
